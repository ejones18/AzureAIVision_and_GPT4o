The team here are excellent, friendly, helpful and dedicated. Pretty much every delivery is spot on and on time. On the very rare occasion of a delivery delay with their 3rd party delivery company, I am sent a text message from Co-op Food within my delivery window with a notification of the delay and that the team is doing all they can to deliver the goods. I even called the branch today to check stock of an item before placing an order online and the chap who answered the phone was very polite, genuinely happy to help and also has a great sense of humour. The phone was answered very quickly as well. My apologies as I forgot to ask for his name but wanted to give 5 star feedback for his and his team's amazing customer service. Thank you...\"\n",
